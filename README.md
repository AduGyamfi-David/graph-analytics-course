# Graph Analytics for Python Developers

## About this course

Graph analytics and graph databases are one of the fastest growing areas in data analytics, and machine learning. Companies like [Google](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/traffic-prediction-with-advanced-graph-neural-networks), [UberEats](https://eng.uber.com/uber-eats-graph-learning/), [Pinterest](https://medium.com/pinterest-engineering/pinsage-a-new-graph-convolutional-neural-network-for-web-scale-recommender-systems-88795a107f48) and [Twitter](https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/topics/insights/2020/graph-ml-at-twitter.html), have leveraged graphs to transform their core products. As more enterprises embrace graphs, there is a huge demand for engineers and data scientists with graph analytics skills.

In this training you will learn everything you need to know to get started building sophisticated applications using Python graph algorithm libraries and visualization tools, and graph databases. You will start with basic graph concepts, work your way to graph algorithms, and finish the course by building a graph-based fraud detection application from scratch.
